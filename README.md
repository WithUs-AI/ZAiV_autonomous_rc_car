JetRacer is an autonomous AI racecar using NVIDIA Jetson Nano.  With JetRacer you will

* Go fast - Optimize for high framerates to move at high speeds

* Have fun - Follow examples and program interactively from your web browser

By building and experimenting with JetRacer you will create fast AI pipelines and push the boundaries of speed.

To get started, follow the [setup](#setup) below.

## Cars

There are two different JetRacer cars that you can build.  They differ primarily in size and speed.  Which one to pick depends on your use case


## Examples

JetRacer comes with a couple examples to get you up and running.  The examples are in the format of Jupyter Notebooks, which are interactive documents which combine text, code, and visualization.  Once you've completed the notebooks, start tweaking them to create your own racing software!

### Example 1 - Basic motion

In this example you'll learn to progam JetRacer programatically from your web browser.  Learn more in the [examples](docs/examples.md) documentation.

### Example 2 - Road following

In this example, you'll teach JetRacer how to follow a road using AI.  After training the neural network using the [interactive training notebook](notebooks/interactive_regression.ipynb), you'll optimize the model using NVIDIA TensorRT and deploy for a live demo. Learn more in the [examples](docs/examples.md).
